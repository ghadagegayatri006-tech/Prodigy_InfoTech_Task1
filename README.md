 Population Data Visualization
Prodigy Infotech – Data Science Internship (Task 01)

# Project Overview
This project is part of Prodigy Infotech’s Data Science Internship – Task 1.
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using a histogram and compare categorical data using bar charts.
The dataset used is the World Bank – World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset containing total population records from 1960 to 2024.
# Objectives
✔ Load and preprocess a real-world dataset
✔ Clean and convert population data into numeric format
✔ Create a Histogram to visualize overall population distribution
✔ Create Bar Charts to compare Top 10 Most Populated Countries
✔ Analyze population trends across different years
# Dataset Information
Source: World Bank – World Development Indicators
Indicator Name: Population, total
Indicator Code: SP.POP.TOTL
Time Period: 1960 – 2024
File Used: population_task_1.csv
# Visualizations Created
 Histogram – Population Distribution
A histogram was created to visualize the overall distribution of population values across countries.
This helps in understanding:
Population spread
Frequency distribution
Range of population values
 Bar Chart – Top 10 Countries by Population
Bar plots were created to compare the Top 10 most populated countries for:
 Year 2018
 Year 2024
This visualization helps to:
Identify countries with highest population
Compare changes between 2018 and 2024
Understand global population patterns
 Tools & Technologies Used
 Python
 Pandas
 Matplotlib
 Jupyter Notebook

# Key Learnings
Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
Handling missing values
Type conversion using pd.to_numeric()
Sorting and filtering top records
Creating meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib
Interpreting real-world population data
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data visualization techniques can extract meaningful insights from large real-world datasets.
The histogram provides insight into overall population distribution, while bar charts highlight the most populated countries and allow year-wise comparison.
Data visualization plays a vital role in exploratory data analysis and decision-making.
